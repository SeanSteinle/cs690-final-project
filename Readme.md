# 2. Report
## Abstract ❌
Over the years, numerous frameworks have emerged that make 3D object detection in the autonomous scenario easier and more robust. Despite the introduction of such frameworks, there are always areas that require improvement. In this project, we have explored a variety of end-to-end 3D object–detection pipelines on the KITTI benchmark to understand how different representations, network backbones, and native CUDA-accelerated modules impact 3D object detection accuracy and speed. The KITTI dataset consists of image and pointcloud data, which can be transformed into structured inputs in the form of voxels, pillars, or bird’s-eye-view (BEV) images, that can be processed by 2D or 3D convolutional backbones. We experimented with different frameworks and finalized three of these to be included in the final report. These are PointPillar, SECOND and PointRCNN.
